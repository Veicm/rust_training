# rust_training

A collection of small programs implemented in both Python and Rust. This repository is intended for practicing Rust, comparing it with Python implementations, and exploring language differences and performance characteristics. Each project is a self-contained exercise to strengthen Rust skills while keeping Python as a reference.

### Recommended Resources:
